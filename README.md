# mood-ring
A mood-based music journaling app that blends emotion, sound, and theory.

🌈 Core Values


Non-linear learning: It’s okay to be “wrong.” That’s part of how we hear better.


Emotion-first, theory-second: The music meets you where you are—not the other way around.


Colorful & tactile: Color = feeling. Interface should feel like touchable sound.


Self-connection > performance: The goal is not to show off—it’s to come home to yourself.
