# ChoshiwaOS Development Sandbox Summary

## Overview
This fork of the original ChoshiwaOS repo was used to set up a live local development environment for experimenting with UI/UX prototypes, musical interfaces, and data visualization ideas.

## What Was Done
- Installed Node.js and npm  
- Installed Vite + Svelte dependencies  
- Cloned and configured local dev environment via PowerShell  
- Edited `vite.config.ts` to add HTTPS support and server configuration  
- Resolved npm dependency warnings and LightningCSS pseudo-class validation issues  
- Successfully launched the dev server at `http://localhost:5173/`

## Learnings
- Understanding of Node package management (`npm install`, `npm run dev`)
- Basics of SSL certificate handling with `mkcert`
- How Viteâ€™s live reload and Svelteâ€™s reactive model work together
- LightningCSS syntax quirks (using `::global` instead of `:global`)

## Next Steps
- Integrate Circle-of-Fifths UI concept  
- Begin front-end prototyping for the **ChoshiwaOS** musical mood selector  
- Explore HTTPS deployment when ready for public preview
