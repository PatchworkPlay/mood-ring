# üåà Mood Rings: A Visual & Sonic Mood Journal

**Mission:**  
Mood Rings is an open-source, exploratory journal where music, mood, and memory intersect.  
It‚Äôs not just a mood tracker.  
It‚Äôs a playground for grief, joy, improvisation, identity, and sound.

**What It Does:**  
- Let users associate sounds (chords, arpeggios, samples) with personal moods
- Let emotions ‚Äúflow‚Äù into musical sketches or patterns
- Visualize mood over time as a radial map, branching sequence, or data flow
- Offer improvisational anchors based on emotion-driven inputs

**Inspired by:**  
- The emotional resonance of chords 
- The structure and beauty of **Muted.io**  
- The flowing data storytelling of **Sankey diagrams**  
- The modular interactivity of circular menus and live journals  
- Childhood memories of music as survival

**This is not:**  
- A sequencer  
- A piano roll  
- A ‚Äúperfect theory‚Äù tool

**This is:**  
- A digital altar to sound and feeling  
- A sonic diary  
- A transcriber of emotion
